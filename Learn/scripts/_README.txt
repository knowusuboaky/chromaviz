These scripts work seperately, and demonstrate how to use the python code 
in your own projects. 

you'll notice they all repeat the same first few lines of code (such as embedding model used, collection name, initialising the embedding function, etc)
to isolate them so they work as standalone examples for each task to help grasp whats needed. 

where theres an "A" and "B" script, the general rule of thumb is:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - A = most simple, basic, straightforward example 
   - B = same example but with all other possible options, and configurations, to demonstrate syntax. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

scripts range from creating collection, adding documents, and querying those documents. 
theres also overview scripts for collections (collection overview), and overview scripts for documents (get all docs with embed)
and deletion scripts to reset everything back to scratch 

theres also an "add many documents" script to give you something to play with out of the box.
